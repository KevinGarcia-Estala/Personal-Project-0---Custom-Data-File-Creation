# Custom Data File Creation
## Overview
I want to be able to create custom data files with a desired data type (numbers) and amount.
## Background/Motivation
Data is always required to test out a program. So instead of placing in a random amount of numbers in to your program manually you can easily just make your program read data instead.
## Objective
The final goal for this project was threefold.
1. To be able to create data files with random assortment of numbers, including negatives and decimal if required
2. Format the data in a custom way in which it can be separated by commas, spaces, enters, and tabs.
3. Be able to customize the size/amount of data that will be placed in the data file.
Additional I would like to be able to design the target platform manually.
## Methodology
To implement the above goals, The following methodology needs to be followed :
1. Allow the user to customize the data created (how long, what numbers, and format for the data)
2. different type of numbers that will be available (decimal, positive, negative, or mixed between all of them)
3. types of formats

## Completed Notes
This project took me roughly five days to complete. I spent one day on writing/outline of the project, four and a half days for the user input, and half a day for writing the data.  
## Reflection on the project
This project was relatively easy for me complete. This project did test my current knowledge of java in a way that was similar to what I have been doing in college but harder. After completing the project I am excited to develop even more projects in the future.
## Things that I can improve on
1. reduce redundant code
	- several instances of the same code of the user inputting just "y" or "n"
	- better understanding of try/catch 
2. more time on planning
	- I should broken down the project even more in order to make it more easier
3. accepting change parts of my code
	- I was reluctant on changing the interface of the project should
		- I should try to achieve a more dynamic programing style
